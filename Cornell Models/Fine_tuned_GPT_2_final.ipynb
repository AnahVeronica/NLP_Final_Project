            " The information provided is only for your understanding and will not be helpful for implementing the concepts taught in class. If you need further clarification regarding any of the information recorded in the lessons please discuss it in the official forums. If you don’t have a sufficient understanding of a subject to draw the information for the students, the faculty will consider you to be lacking the necessary understanding. If you need further assistance with a topic of your own choosing between the exercises, exercises_in.pl and exercises.out.pl, please get in the chat. The faculty reserves the flexibility to change the exercises and is bound by the assignment and participation deadlines. You need to be careful before changing some part of your code if you approach a question differently as the auto-correct only occurs once every five minutes. If you need additional assistance regarding a question about the way in which the auto-correcting functionality is being offered, you need to submit a private message on edstem in the lessons tab. If you don’t have a private message on edstem and are not logged in, private message us on edstem with your details.[question]I don’t have a homework partner, what are I to do?answerLabs are not graded but will be helpful for implementing the concepts taught in class. The pre-licensure labs are auto-graded once a week. The pre-licensure sessions will not be released until after class is over. The pre-licensures are subject to change and the students have access to all the captured video materials and live streaming. Labs are to be used only for session per week. Doing so will invalidate the session. Developers have access to all the captured video materials and live streaming. The faculty reserves the flexibility to change the presentation of the captured video materials. You need to be careful before changing some part of your code if you approach a question differently as the auto-grader does not accept alternative solutions please follow the instructions. Ten percent of your grade is participation. Attendance is graded and has a small percent in the final grade. Labs are not to be considered pre-licensures. Do not share your code with others as it is in violation of our code of conduct.[question]Do I have access to the video recorded materials?answerNo. Access to all AI-1 Class Information and to all the video captured materials is granted under the HMDL. You will work in teams of four on a topic of your choice based on what you learnt in the course. You will acquire the data, design, and implement your application using the tools and techniques learned during the course.<|endoftext|>\n",

The faculty reserves the flexibility to change the grade thresholds for the final grade. Exercises and the post class quizzes comprise of a total of thirty five percent of the final grade. The pre class quizzes are only for your understanding and will not be graded. The exercises need to be submitted before set deadlines and they are auto graded by the edstem platform. You need to be careful before changing some part of your code if you approach a question differently as the auto grader does not accept alternative solutions please follow the instructions.
